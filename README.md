# Rsbuild template repository

This is a template repository for `rsbuild` with `React` and `TypeScript`. It uses `bun` instead of Node.js and `biome` instead of `prettier / eslint` for better performance.

2. Change the license in the `LICENSE` file and in the `package.json` file
3. Update `assetPrefix` in `rsbuild.config.ts` to your repository name
4. Install the dependencies via `bun install`
5. Update this `README.md` file
